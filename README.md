# simple_appointments_agenda

This is a simple appointments agenda app that allows you to create, read and update appointments
(deleting appointment is still in progress :)).

This application uses the library provided by SIMFORM, available [here](https://pub.dev/packages/calendar_view). 
Thank you, SIMFORM! 

## How to run the app
You simply need to have flutter installed on your machine and 
run the following command in the project's root directory:

```
flutter run
```

Keep in mind that if you want to test the application on a mobile device, you'll have to connect a
physical device with development options enabled OR use an emulator.
